Sample C++ ISAPI filter and extension

This is a sample IIS filter & extension that prints out a custom header and echos the post back.

It is useful for debugging issues with filters related to other extensions (or ASP.net) eating POSTS requests.

It is also a simple example of creating a combo filter & extension for IIS 7.0/7.5.
